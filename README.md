## Core Project Statement
An online service capable of storing, bundling and consuming articles you find all over the internet, in a clean UI.
Then how does it work exactly?
So you as a user sign in in your account. There you can paste an URL of an article you want to save.
The app then scrapes the URL and saves the website content to your account. 
There you can manage all your articles, bundle them and consume them.
You can read the articles in a clean book-style UI.
I'm planning on experimenting with the Google Text-To-Speech API to see if reading them to you is possabilty and if it sound okay enough to listen to for longer periods of times.

## Who is this for
You, the consumer, the digital poweruser who reads github repo readme's. 
Everyone who reads articles online on a regular basis. 
People who source recipies from all over the internet. 
People who want to keep articles they find interesting. 
You get the picture..  If you're a regular internet user, you could propably use something like this.

## Deliverables 
A web app, most suites for mobile use (but usable on all devices ofcourse), capable of: 
  - Signing in as a user.
  - Paste URL's to save an article
  - Scraping those URL's and saving it's information for later in the user's account.
  - displaying the articles in a beautiful book-read-type UI
It should be able to be downloaded on your homescreen.
It should be deployable to the app store. (hyrbid app)
