    <p class="landing__header__p">Mockup sites. They're the worst. Redirect after redirect after waiting 5 seconds after filling in personal data and selling your soul. There is a new go to spot for your mockups!  Malli.graphics is here to change that!</p>
    <p class="landing__header__p">We have an awesome collection of high quality mockups, hand picked by us, a team of designers from a small Belgian agency. We support the designer community, We have to. </p>
    <p class="landing__header__p">The mockups are sources from all over the internet. Since we do not want to steal these, or cannibalise on someone else's work, we redirect you to the origin owner of the mockup,but only to sites where you aren't redirected again, or have to fill in a ton of shit just in order to download your mockup.We'll make sure of it! This one redirect is necessary to support the original creator and the designer community in general.</p>
